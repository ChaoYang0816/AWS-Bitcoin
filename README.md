# AWS-Bitcoin
To running the code, you should already download the awscli, as there have the valid config and credentials file in your .aws document.
Also please save the test.py as the s3 file, please remember to set the s3 file as the public authority and copy the url to replace the url of the "user data" section of the connection.py
The idea of the code is that run the connection.py, it will prompt few questions helps the user input the number of the virtual machine they want to set, the difficulty level and the input text.
When the Vm finish analyse the code, it will return the result to the user and terminate the VMs.
